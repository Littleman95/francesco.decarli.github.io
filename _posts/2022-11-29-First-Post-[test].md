Hello, everyone!
My name is Francesco and I'm try by myself to create a personal site. My main idea is to share all the interesting things I do with all of you, this way everyone who's interested will be able to use what I share, and it also will be useful as something like a portfolio.

Now, this is just the first post I've done, so I'm still learning about how it works, but it looks really interesting!
