### Template [discarded]
Started this from a template [available here on GitHub](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). It will be my first step toward my site.
I've comprehended that this template is not what I was searching for. I'm looking for something dynamic, that I can personalize, that's why I've changed my source guide.

# Guide
As stated in the previous point, I've changed my source in order to get something that I can customize. This is a new start and I'll see if this is what I'm searching for.
My sousce is now [this one from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-simple-website/)

# Goal
My main idea is to create a personal site where to share anything that will cross my mind that will be shareable or useful for other people.
I know I have lot to learn before caming up with something that will be look as an actual site, but I want to do it, step after step, with my pace.
