    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p id="msg">General things to remember:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="list"><b>html</b> file (HyperText Markup Language) is the <b>content</b> displayed in the actual webpage</li>
        <li><b>css</b> file (Cascading Style Sheets) contains general information about the <b>page styling</b></li>
        <li><b>js</b> file contains how <b>interactions</b> contained in your page will work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CSS things to remember:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>"RULES"</b>: are the ones that styles the html markup (head, body, h1, p, ul, ol, li, etc.)</li>
        <li><b>"CLASS SELECTOR"</b>: '.list' is e of them.
            Each HTML element that contains a class attribute set to list will get the styles that are defined within this selector.</li>        
        <li><b>"ID SELECTOR"</b>: '#msg' is one of them.
            The HTML element that has its id attribute set to msg will get the styles that are defined within this selector.</li>        
        <li>It <u>uses inheritance mechanism</u> from parent elements to their descendants (key aspects of CSS).</li>
        <li>To define a set of <u>global CSS variables</u> use a CSS rule with the ':root' selector.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>JS thisngs to remember:</p>
    <ol type="I">
        <li><b>"script"</b> can be placed in <i>head</i> or right before the closing <i>body</i>.
            If the latter is choosed, then it gives the possibility to all the pages content to be displayed on the screen first,
            and then to load the script.</li>
        <li><b>"noscript"</b> is a <u>message</u> that appears if JavaScript is deactivated,
            thus the code can detect and plan for when a feature isn't supported or available.</li>
        <li>Enabling 'strict mode' (in js) will let you know when you made mistakes,
            otherwise JavaScript will let you make mistakes handling them by itself, but it will be harder to find them in the future.</li>
        <li><b>Event Handler</b> is a way to run a JavaScript function when the specified event occurs on the page.
            With 'document.querySelector' you can link the reference to the involved element.
            Before this command you find the variable with the reference stored.</li>
        <li><b>Console Message</b> are hidden messages that won't appear on the webpage but that are displayed in the Developer Tools.
            These are extremely helpful to check your code.</li>
    </ol>
